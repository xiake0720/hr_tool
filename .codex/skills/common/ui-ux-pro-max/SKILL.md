# Purpose
Provide the full UI/UX Pro Max workflow and searchable guidance for frontend styling.

# Usage
Use the scripts from the bundled skill package:

```bash
python3 D:/ht-tools-platform/.codex/skills/common/ui-ux-pro-max/ui-ux-pro-max-skill/src/ui-ux-pro-max/scripts/search.py "<query>" --design-system
```

# Notes
- This skill is the primary UI/UX Pro Max reference.
- The lightweight `common-ui-style-ui-ux-pro-max` skill remains as a concise style constraint,
  but for full design guidance use this skill.
